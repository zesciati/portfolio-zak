## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
.
├── public
│   └── images
└── src
    ├── components
    │   └── Projects.astro
    ├── layouts
    │   └── Layout.astro
    ├── pages
    │   └── index.astro
    └── style
        └── global.css
        
```
